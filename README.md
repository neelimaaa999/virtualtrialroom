# Virtual Trial Room

## Overview
The **Virtual Trial Room** is a real-time virtual try-on system that allows users to try on clothes virtually using their webcam. It uses pose detection and overlay techniques to simulate how clothing items would fit a user’s body. The system is built using Python and integrates key technologies like OpenCV, MediaPipe, and machine learning.

## Features
- Real-time webcam input for user body tracking.
- Gender-specific clothing overlays for a personalized experience.
- Pose and hand detection to align clothing images on the user’s body.
- Easy-to-use graphical interface for smooth navigation.
- Dynamic fitting room experience with clothes being displayed according to the user's body shape.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language for the application.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time image processing and webcam input.
- **MediaPipe**: For pose and hand detection.
- **Tkinter**: For the user interface.
